<p>Hey there, I see you're in the process of setting up QuincyKit's remote side.  To continue you should really setup the .htaccess file.  A template has been created for you called htaccess.txt</p>

<p>If leaving your QuincyKit web interface open to the public isn't a concern for you you can simply <a href="admin/">head over the to the admin</a>.</p>
