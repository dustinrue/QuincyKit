<title>You should enable the .htaccess file</title>
<body>
<p>Hey there, I see you're in the process of setting up QuincyKit's remote side.  To continue you should really setup the .htaccess files.  Template .htaccess files have been provided in the install directory.  The file htaccess.txt here, in your document root.  The adminhtaccess belongs in the admin directory.</p>

<p>If leaving your QuincyKit web interface open to the public isn't a concern for you you can simply <a href="admin/">head over the to the admin</a>.</p>
